- there isnt really a way to currently know which agent is best, as a bunch of them all get 10/10...
- maybe we need to run like 10 games per generation, add in the amount of turns in each game, give points for acquiring/spending resources, lose points for losing resources for more granularity
- multiprocessed games.. run on 10 cores.
- play_turn lobe
- move_robber take resources from other players where available
- print out each generation that we're currently at...
- export the best player from the population...
- start from a checkpoint
