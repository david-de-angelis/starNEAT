    """
    A genome for star-neat neural networks.

    Terminology
        pin: Point at which the network is conceptually connected to the external world;
             pins are either input or output.
        node: Analog of a physical neuron.
        connection: Connection between a pin/node output and a node's input, or between a node's
             output and a pin/node input.
        key: Identifier for an object, unique within the set of similar objects.

    Design assumptions and conventions.
        1. Each output pin is connected only to the output of its own unique
           neuron by an implicit connection with weight one. This connection
           is permanently enabled.
        2. The output pin's key is always the same as the key for its
           associated neuron.
        3. Output neurons can be modified but not deleted.
        4. The input values are applied to the input pins unmodified.
